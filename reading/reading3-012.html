        <h2>Brothers</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>John and Mark were brothers, but they were quite different people. Mark looked very <span class="newword">masculine</span>. He had a mustache and was very <span class="newword">muscular</span>. He was a sculptor. He made things out of stone. Mark was a good artist, but he was not very intelligent.
          </p>
          <p>John looked nothing like his brother. He was small and weak, but he was very smart. John was an <span class="newword">undergraduate</span> in college, and he studied <span class="newword">anthropology</span> and history. He knew a lot about ancient cultures. The brothers loved each other very much, but they thought they had nothing in common.
          </p>
          <p>One day, the mayor <span class="newword">appointed</span> Mark to build a <span class="newword">monument</span>: a statue of Egyptian Pharaoh, Tut. Mark agreed to do the job, but he had a problem. He had no idea who Pharaoh Tut was! However, he thought he had the <span class="newword">competence</span> to build a good statue anyway. He made some <span class="newword">crude</span> measurements and sculpted a statue of a very old man with a <span class="newword">tattoo</span> on his chest. Mark was proud of his work, but when John saw the statue, he laughed aloud.
          </p>
          <p>“What's so funny?” Mark asked.
          </p>
          <p>John replied, “Your <span class="newword">ignorance</span> makes me laugh. Don't you know that Tut was only a teenager when he was pharaoh? Let me help you. I'll <span class="newword">supervise</span> your work. I'll give you <span class="newword">feedback</span>, and we'll make this a great monument.”
          </p>
          <p>Mark got another <span class="newword">cube</span> of stone. John told him what Tut looked like. “Make him tall with good <span class="newword">posture</span>,” John said. “And make sure there is <span class="newword">symmetry</span> in his body.”
          </p>
          <p>Mark conferred with John about every detail. For ten consecutive hours, the brothers worked. At last, the finished statue was <span class="newword">situated</span> in front of the museum. Everyone <span class="newword">applauded</span> the brothers' good work.
          </p>
          <p>“We worked together very well. I guess we are <span class="newword">compatible</span> after all,” Mark said.
          </p>
          <p>John replied, “I agree! When we combine our talents, we are capable of greatness.”</p>
