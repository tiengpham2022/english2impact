        <h2>The Starfish</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Last summer I took a trip to an <span class="newword">island</span>. I had a lot of fun. I sat and watched the <span class="newword">waves</span> and listened to the <span class="newword">ocean</span>. I learned to <span class="newword">identify</span> birds. I <span class="newword">discovered</span> pretty things and enjoyed the <span class="newword">taste</span> of new foods. It was a very nice time.
          </p>
          <p>One evening I took a <span class="newword">pleasant</span> walk by the ocean. When the waves came in, many starfish* fell on the <span class="newword">beach</span>. Some starfish went back into the water, and they were safe. But other starfish were <span class="newword">still</span> on the sand. They would die if they did not get into the water. There were many starfish on the beach that night. It made me sad, but I knew I could not <span class="newword">fix</span> the problem. I <span class="newword">stepped</span> very carefully so I did not <span class="newword">damage</span> them.
          </p>
          <p>Then I saw a little girl. She was also sad about the starfish. She wanted to <span class="newword">prevent</span> all of them from dying. She asked me if I could <span class="newword">perhaps</span> help her.
          </p>
          <p>“To be <span class="newword">frank</span>, I don't think we can do anything,” I said.
          </p>
          <p>The little girl started to cry. She sat back <span class="newword">against</span> a <span class="newword">rock</span> and thought for a while. Finally, the <span class="newword">emotion</span> was gone. She stopped crying and stood up. Then she picked up a starfish and <span class="newword">threw</span> it into the water.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you doing?” I asked her. But she did not answer me. She just threw as many starfish as she could. “You cannot <span class="newword">save</span> all of them!” I said.
          </p>
          <p>She stopped to look at me. “No, I cannot save them all,” she replied. Then she picked up a very big starfish and said, “But I can save this one.” And then she smiled and threw the starfish as far as she could into the ocean.
          </p>
