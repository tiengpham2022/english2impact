        <h2>The Report</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>Lee sat <span class="newword">among</span> the books at the <span class="newword">library</span> and thought about his group project.
        </p>
        <p>They had to turn it in soon, but he hadn't even started his part! Jack and Claire were in his group. They had worked hard. They were also very smart, and Lee didn't want them to get a bad <span class="newword">grade</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Jack did the report. He wrote a lot of very good sentences and <span class="newword">described</span> things with great adjectives. Claire drew a nice map of the stars. Now, Lee needed to do his part of the project.
        </p>
        <p>“Well, I <span class="newword">suppose</span> I need to start my model,” Lee thought.
        </p>
        <p>Making a model of a <span class="newword">planet</span> was really hard. Lee tried to read <span class="newword">several</span> books, but he couldn't <span class="newword">comprehend</span> any of the <span class="newword">charts</span>. “We're going to <span class="newword">fail</span> because of me!” Lee said. He put his head down on the table and said, “I wish I could see a planet, <span class="newword">instead</span> of having to read about it!”
        </p>
        <p><span class="newword">Suddenly</span>, there was a bright light. Lee was pulled from his chair, through the roof, and right into a strange ship! “Hello, kid,” said an <span class="newword">alien</span>. “Did you ask for help?”
        </p>
        <p>Lee told the <span class="newword">friendly</span> alien all about his project. The alien agreed to help Lee <span class="newword">solve</span> his problem. “First, we'll fly through space to <span class="newword">view</span> the <span class="newword">universe</span>. Then, I can help you make a model of my planet.”
        </p>
        <p>Soon, they were going through the <span class="newword">clouds</span>. They passed the moon. Then they viewed Mars. Lee was very excited. Instead of a bad grade, his group would have the best project <span class="newword">ever</span>!
        </p>
        <p>“It's time to go home,” the alien finally said. On the way back, he helped Lee make a model of the planet
        </p>
        <p>Mars. Soon, they were on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>“Thanks,” Lee said. “My model will be awesome!” Then he took his model and said goodbye to his new friend.</p>
