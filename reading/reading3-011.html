        <h2>Beethoven's Gift</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Beethoven was a great composer of classical music in the 1800s. Many <span class="newword">biographies</span> have been written that <span class="newword">narrate</span> his <span class="newword">dominance</span> in the music world. But do you know what really makes him special? Even though millions of people got to hear his <span class="newword">multiple masterpieces</span>, he never did. Beethoven wrote his best pieces after he went completely deaf!
          </p>
          <p>His <span class="newword">partiality</span> toward classical music developed when he was very young. He wasn't interested in anything else as a child. When he was five, he learned how to play the piano. From then, nothing could stop his passion for writing and playing music.
          </p>
          <p>When Beethoven was twenty, he began to lose his hearing. He got <span class="newword">acute</span>, <span class="newword">spontaneous</span> pains in his ears. His hearing kept getting worse over time. It was <span class="newword">inevitable</span> that he would eventually lose it altogether. It was very hard for him to keep writing music. He lost the <span class="newword">virtue</span> of patience, and he became <span class="newword">notorious</span> for his <span class="newword">aggression</span>. Still, he never stopped trying. His passion for music <span class="newword">compelled</span> him to keep performing even after he went deaf. He couldn't hear himself play, but he knew that his creations sounded <span class="newword">gorgeous</span>.
          </p>
          <p>His final concert was held at a huge <span class="newword">banquet</span>. He gave the musicians a cue, and they began to play. He directed the concert with all his heart. He couldn't hear the music, but he said that he could feel it. <span class="newword">Overall</span>, performance was one of the finest in history. When it was over, he turned to the crowd. They <span class="newword">clapped</span> and cheered wildly. In that beautiful moment, the applause <span class="newword">boosted</span> his emotions, and he began to cry.
          </p>
          <p>In 1827, he suffered from lead poisoning. He didn't survive the sickness, but his music did because great music never becomes <span class="newword">outdated</span>. Even though Beethoven is gone, his <span class="newword">legacy</span> will live on forever.</p>
