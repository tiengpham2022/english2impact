        <h2>The Jackal  and the Sun Child</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>A jackal is a <span class="newword">wild</span> dog with a big black back. It <span class="newword">resides</span> in the desert. But how did the jackal get his black back? This was how it happened.
          </p>
          <p>One day, the jackal saw a girl. She was sitting upon a rock. She was not a <span class="newword">normal</span> child. She was a <span class="newword">rare</span> and beautiful sun child. She was bright and warm like the sun. The child saw the jackal and smiled.
          </p>
          <p>She said, “Jackal, I have been <span class="newword">relaxing</span> on this rock for too long. I must get home soon. But, I am slow and you are fast. You will <span class="newword">likely</span> get me home more quickly.” Then she <span class="newword">requested</span>, “Will you carry me home? If you do, I'll give you a gift. This necklace <span class="newword">belongs</span> to me, but I will give it to you.”
          </p>
          <p>The wild jackal agreed. So the sun child sat on the dog's back. They started to walk. But soon, the jackal felt ill. The sun child was very hot on his back. The heat was <span class="newword">hurting</span> his back very <span class="newword">badly</span>. “I made a terrible <span class="newword">error</span> in <span class="newword">judgment</span>.” he thought. He shouldn't have agreed to carry her. So he asked her to get off.
          </p>
          <p>But she did not. The jackal's back <span class="newword">continued</span> to get hotter and hotter. He had to get away from the sun child. So he made a plan. First, he ran as fast as he could.
          </p>
          <p>He hoped the sun child would fall off. But she did not. So when the sun child was looking at the sky, not <span class="newword">aware</span> of the jackal's next plan, he jumped into a <span class="newword">field</span> of flowers. As a <span class="newword">result</span>, the child <span class="newword">rolled</span> off his back. The jackal ran away.
          </p>
          <p>But the sun child left a mark on the jackal's back, a <span class="newword">visible</span> black mark. Ever <span class="newword">since</span> his <span class="newword">experience</span> with the sun child, the jackal has had a black back.</p>
