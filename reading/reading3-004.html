        <h2>The Corrupt Administrator</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>Mr. Pig was an <span class="newword">administrator</span> at a big factory that made different kinds of <span class="newword">merchandise</span>. During a meeting at the company's <span class="newword">headquarters</span>, his bosses said they wanted the factory to make more money.
        </p>
        <p>“If the factory makes more money, then you will too,” his boss, Mr. Horse, told him. It was a great <span class="newword">incentive</span>. Pig had always wanted to be as <span class="newword">affluent</span> as his bosses.
        </p>
        <p>Mr. Pig returned to the factory and started making changes. However, most were not very nice, and some were not <span class="newword">legitimate</span>.
        </p>
        <p>First, he fired all his employees. Then he <span class="newword">automated</span> the entire factory. Machines now made everything, and the other animals, Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Sheep, and Mr. Dog had no jobs. Next, he <span class="newword">bribed</span> some <span class="newword">corrupt</span> senators into <span class="newword">legislating</span> special <span class="newword">subsidies</span> for the factory. Finally, instead of paying a company to <span class="newword">dispose</span> of the factory's <span class="newword">rubbish</span> properly, he <span class="newword">violated</span> the law by throwing it into the river to save money.
        </p>
        <p>At first, all the changes to the factory's <span class="newword">infrastructure</span> created more <span class="newword">revenue</span>. But soon many stores could no longer sell the factory's goods at <span class="newword">retail</span>. It seemed that the machines couldn't make products as well as the workers. The customers were disappointed with the factory's merchandise.
        </p>
        <p>There were other problems, too. The animals had told their friends and family to stop buying the factory's goods. Officials discovered the factory's rubbish in the river, and when they <span class="newword">audited</span> the company, they discovered that Pig had <span class="newword">manipulated</span> the law in order to get more money.
        </p>
        <p>All <span class="newword">transactions</span> with Pig's factory stopped. The factory lost money, and Pig lost his job. He realized his mistakes too late. He had tried to become rich by saving money any way possible, but the cheapest way was not always the best.</p>
