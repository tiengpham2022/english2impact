        <h2>How the Sun and the Moon Were Made</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Do you ever wonder where the moon and the sun came from? The Inuit people of Alaska have a <span class="newword">theory</span>.
          </p>
          <p>They tell a story about a beautiful girl. She was very nice. In <span class="newword">contrast</span>, her brother was a mean little boy. One day he <span class="newword">proposed</span> something. “We should go to a party,” he said. The girl <span class="newword">accepted</span>. First, it was <span class="newword">necessary</span> for her to prepare. She <span class="newword">arranged</span> her hair and put on nice clothes. This <span class="newword">required</span> a lot of time. But the girl worked hard, and soon she had <span class="newword">success</span>. She looked perfect.
          </p>
          <p>They <span class="newword">attended</span> the party together. The girl was having fun. Later, she walked into the bathroom. Suddenly, the lights were turned off! Someone <span class="newword">grabbed</span> her hair and <span class="newword">tore</span> her clothes. She ran out of the bathroom. She wanted to know who did this to her.
          </p>
          <p>Then she had an idea. She fixed her hair again. This time it was even more beautiful. She even <span class="newword">balanced</span> beautiful jewels in it. She wanted to <span class="newword">encourage</span> the person to grab it again. She put black dirt in her hair. The <span class="newword">purpose</span> of this was to catch the person.
          </p>
          <p>She went to the bathroom again, and it was the same <span class="newword">pattern</span>. The lights went off, and someone grabbed her hair. When he <span class="newword">released</span> it, his hand was black. The girl returned to the party. She knew there was only a <span class="newword">single</span> person with a black hand. When she saw that person, he was very <span class="newword">familiar</span>. It was her brother!
          </p>
          <p>He ran into the woods. The girl ran after him. They both carried fire so they could see in the dark. The smoke went into the air. As they ran, they grew. They became <span class="newword">huge</span>. Then they went into space. When the girl's fire went out, she <span class="newword">hung</span> in the sky. She became the moon, and her brother became the sun. They chase each other forever.</p>
