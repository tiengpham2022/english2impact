        <h2>Anna the Babysitter</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>Since her parents got a divorce, Anna has had to help her mother. In her mother's  <span class="newword">absence</span>, Anna takes care of Grace, the baby. At first, Anna thought it was an easy job.
        </p>
        <p>One afternoon, Anna played with Grace. She meowed like a cat and Grace  <span class="newword">imitated</span> her. In fact, Grace  <span class="newword">reproduced</span> every sound that Anna made. She took her sister outside. She put Grace in the  <span class="newword">wagon</span>, but there was  <span class="newword">nowhere</span> for them to go. So they went back inside.
        </p>
        <p>Anna put the  <span class="newword">infant</span> on the floor and went into her room. But when she came back, Grace had  <span class="newword">vanished</span>! Anna looked everywhere, but she could not find her sister. Maybe the baby had been  <span class="newword">kidnapped</span>! “Where are you?” Anna called  <span class="newword">aloud</span>.
        </p>
        <p>The situation was becoming  <span class="newword">urgent</span>. She wanted to call her mom, but she didn't want her to think Anna couldn't do the job. Anna sat down. What was she going to do?
        </p>
        <p>But then, Anna heard something. It was coming from her room. “ Grace?” She got down on her knees and looked under the bed. She could see Grace's  <span class="newword">bald</span> head. Grace had followed Anna into her room and  <span class="newword">crept</span> under the bed.
        </p>
        <p>“What a  <span class="newword">relief</span>!” Anna cried.
        </p>
        <p>She picked up her sister and  <span class="newword">patted</span> her on the head. Her head was soft and had no  <span class="newword">wrinkles</span>. Grace was  <span class="newword">sucking</span> on her thumb and looked tired. So, Anna wrapped her in a  <span class="newword">blanket</span> and sang  <span class="newword">rhymes</span> for her. Then she put Grace in bed for a  <span class="newword">nap</span>.
        </p>
        <p>After that afternoon, Anna knew that taking care of Grace was notan easy job. It takes a lot of work to take care of a baby!
