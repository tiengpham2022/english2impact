        <h2>The Helpful Apprentice</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>There was once a small restaurant. People said that the best <span class="newword">chef</span> in the world worked there. But the chef was a <span class="newword">horrible</span> person to work for. He was <span class="newword">impolite</span> and <span class="newword">scolded</span> his workers all the time.
          </p>
          <p>The chef had a young <span class="newword">apprentice</span>. The apprentice's first <span class="newword">priority</span> was to make the best food in the world. He was happy to have a good teacher, but he didn't like the chef. The boy was a <span class="newword">diligent</span> worker, but the chef scolded him more than anyone else.
          </p>
          <p>Then one day, the chef got great news. The <span class="newword">emperor</span> wanted to have dinner there that night. He was very excited. He was working very fast, and he made a mistake. He cut his hand with a knife, and it started to <span class="newword">bleed</span>. The apprentice gave him a <span class="newword">bandage</span>, but the chef still couldn't cook.
          </p>
          <p>The chef started to <span class="newword">panic</span>. The apprentice tried to <span class="newword">assure</span> him. “Everything will be OK,” he said. But the chef was still afraid. Then they started to work together. They began to <span class="newword">bond</span>. The chef told the apprentice what to do. The boy cooked a great meal.
          </p>
          <p>As soon as they finished, the emperor arrived. He wore a beautiful <span class="newword">robe</span> made of soft <span class="newword">fibers</span>. He also had a <span class="newword">massive crown</span>. Everyone in the restaurant <span class="newword">kneeled</span> when the emperor came in. The chef and the boy brought out his food. The emperorwas used to <span class="newword">luxuries</span>. Would he like the food?
          </p>
          <p>The emperor loved the food. After his <span class="newword">departure</span>, the chef was very proud and very thankful to his new friend, the apprentice.
          </p>
