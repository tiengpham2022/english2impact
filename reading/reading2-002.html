        <h2>The Shepherd  and the Wild Sheep</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="newword"></span>
          Once there was a <span class="newword">shepherd</span>. Every night he counted and gathered his sheep. He was sure never to <span class="newword">overlook</span> any of them. One night, he saw some wild sheep had joined his herd. He hoped to <span class="newword">acquire</span> the <span class="newword">newcomers</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It snowed that night. In the morning, the shepherd couldn't take his sheep out of his <span class="newword">lodge</span>. Instead, he had to feed them inside. He gave a small amount of <span class="newword">wheat</span> to his own sheep. But he gave more of the food to the wild sheep. He thought the extra wheat would <span class="newword">discourage</span> them from leaving.
        </p>
        <p>
          It snowed for several days. During that time, the shepherd's sheep ate very little. The wild sheep, however, ate very well.
        </p>
        <p>
          At last, the snow melted, and they <span class="newword">ventured</span> outdoors. As soon as he opened the door of his <span class="newword">hut</span>, the wild sheep started to run away.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Wait! This is how you <span class="newword">repay</span> me? After I treated you so kindly, why do you run away?” the shepherd asked. His voice was full of <span class="newword">hatred</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wild sheep stopped and turned toward the shepherd.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We're leaving because you fed us betterthan your own sheep,”one of the wild sheep replied. “ You tried to <span class="newword">deceive</span> us with your <span class="newword">ridiculous</span> plan. Yesterday you treated us kindly, but tomorrow you might be different. If more wild sheep joined your herd, you would treat us as <span class="newword">inferior</span> sheep.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As the wild sheep ran away, the shepherd understood his <span class="newword">offense</span>. He knew this <span class="newword">awkward</span> situation was his own fault. He had not been a <span class="newword">satisfactory caretaker</span>. He was a <span class="newword">fake</span> friend to the wild sheep. Because of this, he had <span class="newword">neglected</span> his own herd.
