        <h2>Tiny Tina</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>In a <span class="newword">distant</span> land, there was a kingdom where <span class="newword">fairies</span> lived. Tina was a fairy. She had yellow curls and wore a dress made of <span class="newword">wool</span>. She always moved with <span class="newword">grace</span>. However, because of her <span class="newword">compact</span> size, she was scared of <span class="newword">mankind</span>.
        </p>
        <p>One day, there was an <span class="newword">eclipse</span> of the sun. The fairies didn't know what was happening. They were scared, so they ran away.
        </p>
        <p>Tina looked for a place to hide. She found a garden with flowers <span class="newword">blooming</span>. Tina had a <span class="newword">passion</span> for flowers. She decided to hide there. She became sleepy and made a <span class="newword">pillow</span> with some leaves. She <span class="newword">whistled</span> happily as she worked, and she fell asleep.
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly, somebody <span class="newword">sneezed</span>. The sound woke Tina up. She saw a very big face looking at her! Tina was so scared that she couldn't move. She could feel her <span class="newword">pulse</span> going very fast.
        </p>
        <p>The big woman went into her house. When she came back, she gave Tina a cup.
        </p>
        <p>The woman sat on the ground among some <span class="newword">decaying</span> leaves. Tina <span class="newword">dipped</span> a finger in the cup and tasted it. It was tea with all kinds of delicious <span class="newword">spices</span> in it. Tina felt <span class="newword">refreshed</span> after drinking the tea.</p>
        <p>“ I'm Wilma,” the lady said. “ I spend all my <span class="newword">leisure</span> time in my garden cutting flowers. Would you like some <span class="newword">dessert</span>?”
        </p>
        <p>Tina said yes. She was hungry, and she wasn't
          frightened anymore. She took a bite of cake and relaxed. “ How did you get to my garden?”
          Tina told Wilma how she got lost.</p>
          <p>“ That's terrible! Let us take you home.”
          </p>
          <p>“ Actually, I think that I want to stay with you,” Tina said. She wasn't scared of big people anymore. Wilma and Tina lived happily ever after.
          </p>
