        <h2>Dalton vs. the Bully</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>Dalton was a nice boy, but sometimes the other boys made fun of him because he was so tall and skinny. Dalton's biggest problem was Mitch. He was a <span class="newword">bully</span> who <span class="newword">boasted</span> about his strength. He <span class="newword">quarreled</span> with the other boys. Sometimes, if boys gave Mitch their lunch money, he would have <span class="newword">mercy</span> and leave them alone.
        </p>
        <p>One day, the boys learned about a special Middle School Olympics. Their gym class was going to be in it. Many kids were excited. But Dalton thought it sounded like <span class="newword">torture</span>.
        </p>
        <p>That morning, Dalton ate plenty of <span class="newword">carbohydrates</span> for breakfast. He entered the gym and looked at the <span class="newword">dial</span> on the clock. It was time to begin. The teacher asked if they were ready. Everyone <span class="newword">nodded</span>, except Dalton.
        </p>
        <p>“I got <span class="newword">stung</span> by a bee. I need to see the nurse.” said Dalton. He made it up so he wouldn't have to play.
        </p>
        <p>“I don't believe you. Get ready to play,” responded the coach.
        </p>
        <p>First, they <span class="newword">wrestled</span>. Then they jumped, <span class="newword">crawled</span> and played other games. But Mitch was <span class="newword">dominant</span> in every event.
        </p>
        <p>They <span class="newword">strained</span> all morning to <span class="newword">defeat</span> him. By lunch, they were <span class="newword">sore</span>. Their entire bodies ailed them. They thought about how to win. They knew the last game of the day was volleyball. Kids who used to be Dalton's <span class="newword">rivals</span> became his <span class="newword">allies</span>. They wanted him to help them beat Mitch. Dalton was going to be Mitch's <span class="newword">opponent</span>.
        </p>
        <p>The game started. Every time Mitch tried to hit the ball over the net, Dalton stopped it. Finally, Mitch used all of his strength. But the ball <span class="newword">bounced</span> off Dalton's hands and back into Mitch's face! Finally Mitch was defeated.
