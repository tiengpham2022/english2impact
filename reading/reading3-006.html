        <h2>The Island</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>“Where am I?” Bob thought to himself when he woke up on a <span class="newword">peculiar</span> beach. “I can't remember what happened.” There had been a bad storm, and Bob's fishing boat sunk. He washed ashore on a small island, but he had gotten hurt during the storm. He had a terrible <span class="newword">migraine</span>, and he had a <span class="newword">fracture</span> in his shoulder. He felt awful. But he had a strong desire to make it home to his <span class="newword">spouse</span> and children. He had to <span class="newword">tolerate</span> all the pain and <span class="newword">devise</span> a plan.
        </p>
        <p>Bob stood up and looked around. “I'll walk to a higher <span class="newword">altitude</span>, so I can see everything around me,” thought Bob. “Maybe I'll gain some <span class="newword">insight</span> about this island and find something to help me escape.” As he walked along a mountain <span class="newword">ridge</span>, he noticed that the tall <span class="newword">indigenous</span> trees looked sturdy and thick. Bob got a brilliant idea. He could build a raft! He cut down some leaves and tree <span class="newword">limbs</span>. Even though his shoulder injury <span class="newword">impaired</span> his ability to carry the materials, he slowly dragged them down the mountain until he reached the <span class="newword">coastline</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Bob was a <span class="newword">proficient</span> builder. He used his building <span class="newword">expertise</span> to line up the limbs and tie them together with long vines. When the raft was finished, Bob was happy with his work. “This will bring me home to my family,” he said with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>At last, Bob was ready to <span class="newword">implement</span> his escape plan. With all his might, he <span class="newword">thrust</span> the raft into the water. He climbed on and began the <span class="newword">quest</span> to find his way home. Bob smiled
        </p>
        <p>again, and thought, “I'm glad I kept a good attitude. It prevented the pain from <span class="newword">deterring</span> me from my plan. <span class="newword">Optimism</span> and ambition make anything possible.” Slowly, he floated out to sea. In a few days, he made it to shore and ran home to see his happy family.
        </p>
