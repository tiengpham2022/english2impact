        <h2>Becoming a Healer</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Years ago, I worked at a small health clinic in a remote country. I had gone there to treat an <span class="newword">obscure</span> syndrome. It attacked people's lungs, causing them to need a <span class="newword">respirator</span> to breathe. I was trying out a new <span class="newword">medication</span> to treat these people instead of using a respirator. If I was successful, I would become famous.
          </p>
          <p>Everything was going fine until war broke out in a nearby country. Many people from that country fled the <span class="newword">hostile</span> invading army. The army wanted to <span class="newword">dominate</span> the people, but the people didn't want to be <span class="newword">oppressed</span>. So they walked hundreds of miles across <span class="newword">barren</span> land to get away.
          </p>
          <p>Some of these people came to our clinic for treatment. I talked with them and learned of their difficulties. They did not beg or complain. I was impressed by their <span class="newword">dignity</span>.
          </p>
          <p>There was one woman I will never forget. Her son suffered from <span class="newword">malnutrition</span> and stomach pain, and she didn't know what to do. Neither did 1.1 was not <span class="newword">adept</span> at treating malnutrition.
          </p>
          <p>Nonetheless, when I saw her sadness, I knew I had to help her son. The woman had been feeding her son bread and water. She had a <span class="newword">misconception</span> that it would be enough for him. However, I knew that he needed to eat vegetables, too. So I took her outside and showed her a <span class="newword">dense</span> patch of <span class="newword">edible</span> plants. I taught her how to dig up the roots, <span class="newword">peel</span> them, and cook them for her son. I explained that she should increase her son's <span class="newword">intake</span> of these vegetables. <span class="newword">Likewise</span>, she should <span class="newword">strive</span> to get him some meat once a week to help him regain his strength.
          </p>
          <p>I sent her off with a <span class="newword">prescription</span> for some pain medicine, but she also left my office with some new <span class="newword">culinary</span> skills. A few weeks later, she returned to tell me her son was healthy again. As thanks, she gave me a beautiful <span class="newword">ceramic</span> bowl.
          </p>
          <p>I never became fanous, but I kept that bowl to remind me what it truly means to heal someone.</p>
