        <h2>The Magic Cup</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Paul and John were brothers. They fought all the time because they both wanted to be leaders of the <span class="newword">agency</span> they both worked at.
          </p>
          <p>There was a <span class="newword">superstition</span> in their town about a magic cup. People said the cup was in a volcano located far away. Anyone who <span class="newword">retrieved</span> the cup would have their wish come true. John and Paul both wanted to find it. Then they could become the leader.
          </p>
          <p>They both left to find the cup. Before their trip, their mother said they should work together. They <span class="newword">dismissed</span> that idea. Even though their trips <span class="newword">originated</span> from the same house, each wanted to travel alone.
          </p>
          <p>They were both <span class="newword">miserable</span> during the trip. They had to <span class="newword">navigate</span> small boats across <span class="newword">shallow</span> rivers and climb difficult <span class="newword">slopes</span>. Their journey <span class="newword">spanned</span> many days. When they finally got close to the volcano, the ground began to <span class="newword">vibrate</span> and the volcano <span class="newword">erupted</span>. <span class="newword">Ash</span> filled the sky and <span class="newword">lava</span> covered everything. John climbed to the top of a hill to keep from getting burned. A few moments later, his brother went up the same hill. They were <span class="newword">confined</span> to the hill until the lava cooled down.
          </p>
          <p>They talked about the things they had seen while wandering around the country. They felt more <span class="newword">sympathy</span> and <span class="newword">affection</span> for each other than ever before. They decided that <span class="newword">fate</span> had brought them together.
          </p>
          <p>The next day they left to finish the <span class="newword">remainder</span> of the trip together. Everything seemed much easier. When they finally found the cup, they learned that it didn't make wishes come true. It was only an ordinary cup. But the trip to reach the cup taught them to work together and love each other.
          </p>
