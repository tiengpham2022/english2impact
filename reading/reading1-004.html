        <h2>The Dog's Bell</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>John's dog was a bad dog. He bit people <span class="newword">frequently</span>. John had great <span class="newword">concern</span> about this. It was not an <span class="newword">appropriate</span> way for a dog to <span class="newword">behave</span>. His friends in the <span class="newword">village</span> always <span class="newword">expected</span> the dog to bite them. The news about John's dog <span class="newword">spread</span> through the village. <span class="newword">None</span> of the people wanted to go to John's house. John tried to <span class="newword">instruct</span> the dog to behave, but it never worked. He tried to be <span class="newword">patient</span> and teach the dog to be <span class="newword">calm</span>. That also didn't work. John didn't want to <span class="newword">punish</span> the dog. “How will I stop my dog's bad <span class="newword">habit</span>?” John asked himself.
          </p>
          <p>John's friend came to talk to him about the <span class="newword">issue</span>. During their important meeting, his friend said, “The people in the village asked me to <span class="newword">represent</span> them. We want your dog to stop this habit. Why don't you put a bell around the dog's neck? This way, we would hear your dog coming down the street.”
          </p>
          <p>John thought this was a great idea. Now, people could stay away from the dog. It would not be able to bite anyone anymore.
          </p>
          <p>The dog liked the bell, too. People looked at him when they heard his bell. This made the dog very <span class="newword">content</span>. He liked the song the bell played when he walked.
          </p>
          <p>One day, John's dog <span class="newword">strolled</span> through the village and met some other dogs. He expected them to want a bell like his. But they laughed at his bell. They said the bell made people <span class="newword">avoid</span> him. John's dog <span class="newword">shook</span> his head. “No, they look at me because they like the bell.”
          </p>
          <p>The other dogs said, “You have the wrong idea of what makes you popular. Of course they like your bell. It tells them where you are so they can avoid you. You aren't able to bite them anymore!”
          </p>
          <p>You see, being popular isn't something <span class="newword">positive</span> when it's for the wrong reason.</p>
