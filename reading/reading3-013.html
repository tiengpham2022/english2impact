        <h2>The Old Hound</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Elvis was a dog that loved to run. He possessed all the <span class="newword">criteria</span> to be a great racing dog. He had long legs, lean muscles, and a strong heart. He was so good that he never lost a race in the northern <span class="newword">hemisphere</span>. <span class="newword">Spectators</span> who bet on dog races always picked Elvis to win.
          </p>
          <p>After ten years of racing, however, Elvis was getting old. His <span class="newword">faculties</span> were not as strong as they used to be. His owner got upset when Elvis started losing. Elvis's owner wasn't a <span class="newword">considerate</span> person. He <span class="newword">degraded</span> the dog all the time. Finally, his owner decided to get rid of him. He threw Elvis in his car and took him to the middle of the forest. He tossed him out and drove away. Elvis was cold and scared. He decided to follow a <span class="newword">brook</span> into the city.
          </p>
          <p>Elvis soon found out that the city was a big and <span class="newword">impersonal</span> place. Everywhere he went, he saw signs that said, “No Dogs Allowed.” <span class="newword">Pedestrians</span> yelled at him. He was sad, hungry,
          </p>
          <p>(((Tjiri,'Uanft.h,fi.,'hmift)bt.that.:dK7Rnr)Je-'VArft.:isJrj'jLRj,and.iinraxinp0as_hi.s_nwn.er.ha£l„hPf“n..H e.)))
          </p>
          <p>was ready to give up when he heard a soft voice say, “What a beautiful <span class="newword">hound</span>!” Elvis looked up and saw an old woman. She said, “You're <span class="newword">entitled</span> to a better life than this. I can take you to a <span class="newword">sanctuary</span> for old dogs like you. I'll <span class="newword">cater</span> to all your needs. Would you like to come with me?”
          </p>
          <p>The woman <span class="newword">escorted</span> Elvis to a beautiful <span class="newword">facility</span>. There was a sign on the <span class="newword">external</span> door that said, “Dogs Welcome!” The interior of the building was painted blue, and shiny <span class="newword">ornaments</span> hung from the ceiling. There was a <span class="newword">heap</span> of tasty bones and bread <span class="newword">crusts</span> for <span class="newword">consumption</span>. Elvis learned there were kind people in the world after all. He was so thankful that he jumped up and licked the woman's face.</p>
