        <h2>The Helpful Abbey</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>It had not rained on the <span class="newword">prairie</span> for several months. Because of the <span class="newword">drought</span>, the climate had become very <span class="newword">arid</span>. There was no <span class="newword">moisture</span> left in the soil. No crops could grow in the dry ground. By wintertime, the people had nothing to eat.
        </p>
        <p>The hungry families heard about an <span class="newword">abbey</span> near the mountains where food and water was still <span class="newword">abundant</span>. So they traveled <span class="newword">inland</span>, across the prairie, to the abbey.
        </p>
        <p>At first only a few families arrived, seeking food and shelter. Then there was <span class="newword">ample</span> food. The monks fed them and let them sleep in the small <span class="newword">cathedral</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Soon, however, more families were arriving every day. These people had to travel farther, so they were in worse condition. The <span class="newword">rugged</span> journey had made their clothes <span class="newword">ragged</span>. They were cold and tired. The tiny cathedral was soon full.
        </p>
        <p>Food became <span class="newword">scarce</span>. The monks began to <span class="newword">grumble</span>. They began to <span class="newword">speculate</span> that there would be no food. “If more families come, we won't make it through the winter,” said a young monk. “We must ask some of them to leave.”
        </p>
        <p>The abbot heard this. “We cannot do that,” he said. “It would be wrong to <span class="newword">deprive</span> them of food and shelter. We took an <span class="newword">oath</span> to help those that need help. All here are in need, so all are <span class="newword">eligible</span> to receive our food and shelter.”
        </p>
        <p>“But we won't have enough,” the monk said.
        </p>
        <p>“That might be true, but we must help them <span class="newword">nonetheless</span>. We will <span class="newword">fast</span>,” the abbot replied. “Also, we will give our rooms in the abbey to those sleeping outside, and we will sleep in the churchyard that <span class="newword">adjoins</span> the cathedral.”
        </p>
        <p>The monks were reluctant at first, but they did what the oldest monk said. By the end of winter, there was still enough food and shelter for everyone. They learned that sometimes helping others means you must give more help than you first expected.
        </p>
