        <h2>Why Monkey Has No Home</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>For five years, there was a <span class="newword">famine</span>. The farmers asked people to <span class="newword">bless</span> them and finally, they had a good <span class="newword">harvest</span>. Since there was now plenty of food, the <span class="newword">pharaoh</span> decided to have a party. The party was a happy <span class="newword">affair</span>. For five days they had a huge feast.
          </p>
          <p>Monkey was very happy. Because of the famine, he was very <span class="newword">slim</span>. He wanted to eat a lot of food.
          </p>
          <p>When he arrived at the feast, hundreds of long tables were filled with food. There were <span class="newword">nuts</span>, bowls of <span class="newword">cereal</span>, and <span class="newword">ripe</span> fruit. He could also smell hot <span class="newword">roasted</span> meat cooking on the <span class="newword">stove</span>.
          </p>
          <p>The <span class="newword">assembly</span> of animals was <span class="newword">merry</span>. However, during the feast, Monkey thought of a <span class="newword">scheme</span> to <span class="newword">exploit</span> the pharaoh's kindness. He decided to steal some of the food and then eat it at home.
          </p>
          <p>All the animals were <span class="newword">cheerful</span>. They didn't notice that monkey was hiding food. After the feast, Monkey took the food to his house and ate it. He repeated this <span class="newword">routine</span> every day for four days.
          </p>
          <p>But on the fifth day, the pharaoh had a surprise. He was going to give all the animals a home. Monkey was very excited. But when he arrived at the pharaoh's home, he could not get through the door. The <span class="newword">diameter</span> of his waist was wider than the doorway. He was too fat!
          </p>
          <p>Monkey asked the pharaoh to forgive him for his <span class="newword">theft</span>. But the pharaoh said no.
          </p>
          <p>“<span class="newword">Pardon</span>?” asked the monkey. He didn't understand why the pharaoh was being unkind.
          </p>
          <p>“Everybody else will have a home now, but not you. Now you know that greed gets you nothing,” explained the pharaoh.
          </p>
