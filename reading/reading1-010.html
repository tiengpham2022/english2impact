        <h2>The First Peacock</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Argos lived in Ancient Greece. He was a husband and a <span class="newword">proud</span> father. He worked hard and did well at his job. But one thing about him wasn't normal. He was born with 100 eyes. Having many eyes was usually a <span class="newword">benefit</span> to him. He had a <span class="newword">chance</span> to see many things.
          </p>
          <p>Also, since he had so many eyes, he was very good at <span class="newword">guarding</span> things. While sleeping, he only <span class="newword">rested</span> a few eyes at a time. The others stayed awake. He worked for Hera, a great goddess. His <span class="newword">primary function</span> was to guard a special cow. The cow was very important to Hera. It was her favorite pet. The most <span class="newword">essential</span> part of his job was to keep the cow alone. It had to be kept <span class="newword">separate</span> from all the other cows and <span class="newword">far</span> away from people.
          </p>
          <p>This was an easy job for Argos. The cow just ate <span class="newword">grass</span> all day. But the god Zeus wanted the cow. He wanted to take it away from Hera. He had a plan. He found a great music player. He asked the man to play a beautiful song for Argos. Zeus was certain Argos would go to sleep.
          </p>
          <p>The song had an <span class="newword">immediate effect</span>. Argos couldn't <span class="newword">focus</span> on his job. He fell asleep. Zeus saw this, and he took the cow.
          </p>
          <p>Hera was very angry with Argos. She turned him into a peacock. She put his many eyes on his <span class="newword">tail</span>. Argos was very sad.
          </p>
          <p>Zeus saw how much <span class="newword">trouble</span> he had caused Argos. He made another plan. He turned Argos into a group of stars. He wanted Argos to <span class="newword">remain</span> in the sky forever. Even today, Argos's <span class="newword">image</span> remains there, above the <span class="newword">site</span> where all his problems began. We can still see him in the night sky.</p>
