        <h2>The Bachelor's Lesson</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>A <span class="newword">keen</span> young <span class="newword">bachelor</span> had finished his studies at the university. As soon as he had received his <span class="newword">diploma</span>, he <span class="newword">asserted</span> to everyone he met that he was the smartest person in town.
        </p>
        <p>“I <span class="newword">excel</span> at everything I study,” he said, bragging about his knowledge. “I've mastered <span class="newword">calculus</span> and <span class="newword">physiology</span>. I even understand the great <span class="newword">theoretical</span> teachings of science, such as <span class="newword">relativity</span>. There is nothing that I don't know. Whether it's the movements of <span class="newword">celestial</span> objects, like planets and stars, or how to <span class="newword">harness</span> the power of <span class="newword">radioactive</span> substances, I know everything.”
        </p>
        <p>But actually, there was something the bachelor did not know. Though his <span class="newword">analytic</span> abilities were great, he failed to notice he was missing something very important in his life.
        </p>
        <p>One day while walking through town, the bachelor witnessed a <span class="newword">collision</span> between two cars. Both drivers appeared to be injured, but the scholar only stood and watched.
        </p>
        <p>He thought to himself, “Those idiots should have been more alert. They really must not be very <span class="newword">competent</span>.” He never thought the drivers needed help.
        </p>
        <p>“Please help me,” said the female driver in a weak voice. “Help me, too,” said the male driver. “I'm hurt and can't move.”
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly the bachelor realized he was the only person near the accident. He quit thinking and ran to help the drivers. He carefully helped them out of their vehicles and then called an ambulance.
        </p>
        <p>The drivers were saved, and the bachelor felt the best he had in his entire life. Studying <span class="newword">mythology</span>, <span class="newword">sociology</span>, and <span class="newword">geology</span> didn't give him this wonderful feeling. It was the act of helping others, not his <span class="newword">cognitive</span> skills, that gave him this great feeling.
        </p>
        <p>He had learned an important lesson. He learned that <span class="newword">intellect</span> isn't everything; being helpful is just as important. “Having only a brain is not enough,” he thought. “You must also have a heart.”</p>
