        <h2>The Little Mice</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>Beth was a very <span class="newword">resourceful</span> and conservative mouse. She knew that winter was coming and that there would soon be a <span class="newword">dearth</span> of food. So she decided to make gathering food for winter her primary job. Gathering food was a <span class="newword">grueling</span> and <span class="newword">mundane</span> activity, but Beth made a <span class="newword">deliberate</span> effort because she knew that it was important. She <span class="newword">allotted</span> herself a few hours every day to collect beans. By winter, she had collected a massive pile and hid them in a <span class="newword">cache</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Beth had a sister named Mary. Mary lacked ambition. She had <span class="newword">fanciful</span> ideas about how she would survive winter. She thought that food would just come to her and that she could work at her own <span class="newword">convenience</span>. She <span class="newword">opted</span> to spend the days playing and dancing, instead of gathering beans. When the final hours of autumn <span class="newword">elapsed</span>, Mary had only a <span class="newword">paltry</span> amount of food stored away.
        </p>
        <p>Mary realized that her food supply was too small to last through winter. She visited her sister. Mary said, “Beth, lamina <span class="newword">dire</span> situation. I didn't gather enough food for winter. Will you let me share your beans? Please have some <span class="newword">empathy</span> for your sister!”
        </p>
        <p>Beth thought for a moment. Then she replied, “Mary, I am truly sorry for you. But I will not give you any of my beans. Instead, I will let you have my empty bag. You can still work hard and gather enough food for the winter. It will be <span class="newword">tedious</span>, but you will learn the value of hard work.”
        </p>
        <p>Beth's words <span class="newword">appalled</span> Mary. Mary cried with <span class="newword">outrage</span>, “There is too much work! I won't have any time to dance or play!”
        </p>
        <p>Beth said, “It is crucial that you gather enough food. You must have <span class="newword">sustenance</span> before you have fun. Go now, and <span class="newword">rectify</span> your situation.”
        </p>
        <p>Mary <span class="newword">griped</span> some more, but she knew that her sister was right. She took the bag and went to work gathering her own beans for the winter.
        </p>
