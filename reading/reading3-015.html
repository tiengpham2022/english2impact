        <h2>The Big Ship</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Ernest looked at his <span class="newword">fleet</span> of ships. Usually, he used them for his firm, which <span class="newword">imported marble</span> statues from other countries. But today he was going fishing. And the ship he chose was his favorite. It had an <span class="newword">elaborate</span> painting on the side that showed a <span class="newword">naval</span> battle. It also had some new <span class="newword">updates</span> to its computer system. His favorite ship's latest <span class="newword">acquisition</span> was a device with a small <span class="newword">grid</span> to show the ship's exact location. This new <span class="newword">accessory</span> kept Ernest from getting lost.
          </p>
          <p>At daybreak, Ernest happily sailed the temperate waters until he was far from land. Then he saw a small boat in the distance. There was an old man standing next to its <span class="newword">mast</span>. He was waving his arms in the air. There was also a boy with his head hanging over the boat's edge. Ernest <span class="newword">inferred</span> that the boy was suffering from <span class="newword">nausea</span>. Both of their clothes were <span class="newword">saturated</span> with sea water. Ernest assumed that they were in trouble. Most people never realized, but Ernest had an <span class="newword">innate</span> desire to help people. He began sailing toward them, eager to <span class="newword">facilitate</span> their rescue and thus solve their <span class="newword">dilemma</span>.
          </p>
          <p>As he got closer to the boat, he was shocked by its simplicity. The boat's wood looked no stronger than <span class="newword">cardboard</span>, and the equipment was old. Still, there were several large fish in a <span class="newword">pouch</span> in the boat.
          </p>
          <p>Ernest threw a large package onto the boat. He yelled, “Here! You can <span class="newword">inflate</span> this boat to get you back to land.”
          </p>
          <p>“Get out of here!” screamed the old man.
          </p>
          <p>Ernest was confused. “Don't you need help?” he asked. “Your ship doesn't seem <span class="newword">adequate</span> enough to sail so far away from land.”
          </p>
          <p>“You've just scared away a huge fish,” the boy said. “We waved to let you know you were too close to us.”
          </p>
          <p>Ernest turned around and headed home. He learned that it's better not to help unless asked to. Otherwise, you might not help anyone at all.</p>
