        <h2>The Laboratory</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="newword"></span>
          Mia's father had a <span class="newword">laboratory</span>, but she had no idea what was in it. Her dad always closed and locked the door when he went in. She knew that he used it to do <span class="newword">projects</span> for work. He never told Mia what these projects were.
        </p>
        <p>One night, Mia <span class="newword">approached</span> the door to the laboratory. She stopped and thought, “I wonder what crazy <span class="newword">experiment</span> he is doing now.” Suddenly, she heard a <span class="newword">loud noise</span>. It sounded like an <span class="newword">evil laugh</span>. The noise <span class="newword">scared</span> her, so she walked quickly back to her room.</p>
        <p>The next night, her friend Liz came to her house. When Liz arrived, Mia told her about the night before. “Oh, it was <span class="newword">terrible</span>,” she said.</p>
        <p>“Why don't we see what is in there?” Liz asked. “It will be a fun <span class="newword">adventure</span>!”</p>
        <p>Mia felt <span class="newword">nervous</span> about going into her father's laboratory, but she agreed. As always, the door was locked. They waited until Mia's father left the laboratory to eat dinner. “He didn't lock the door!” Liz said. “Let's go.”</p>
        <p>The laboratory was dark. The girls walked down the stairs <span class="newword">carefully</span>. Mia <span class="newword">smelled</span> strange <span class="newword">chemicals</span>. What terrible thing was her father <span class="newword">creating</span>?</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they heard an evil laugh. It was even <span class="newword">worse</span> than the one Mia heard the night before. What if a monster was going to <span class="newword">kill</span> them? Mia had to do something. She <span class="newword">shouted</span> for help.</p>
        <p>Mia's father ran into the room and turned on the lights.</p>
        <p>“Oh, no,” he said. “You must have learned my <span class="newword">secret</span>.”</p>
        <p>“Your monster tried to kill us,” Mia said.</p>
        <p>“Monster?” he asked. “You mean this?” He had a pretty doll in his hands. The doll laughed. The laugh didn't sound so evil anymore. “I made this foryour birthday. I wanted to give it to you then, but you can have it now. I hope you like it!”</p>
