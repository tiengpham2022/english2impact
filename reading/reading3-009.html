        <h2>The Weaving Machine</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>Mr. Joseph Franklin invented a machine that could <span class="newword">weave</span> cloth. It wove faster and straighter than anyone could weave by hand. He decided to take it to two cities on a <span class="newword">peninsula</span>, Netherton and Wilton. In these cities, a large <span class="newword">proportion</span> of the people worked in weaving. Joseph felt sure he could sell his machine there.
          </p>
          <p>Joseph first took his machine to the mayor of Netherton. “Think of the money you will earn from this machine!” Joseph said to him.
          </p>
          <p>But the mayor was a <span class="newword">benevolent</span> man. He knew about the people's <span class="newword">dependence</span> on weaving for their livelihood. If he bought the machine, the people would lose their jobs. So he refused to buy it.
          </p>
          <p>Joseph said, “We are no longer in the <span class="newword">medieval</span> age! Soon everything will be made by machines. Cloth made by hand will soon be <span class="newword">obsolete</span>. If you don't change your <span class="newword">archaic</span> ways, your town's income will <span class="newword">diminish</span>!”
          </p>
          <p>But the mayor said, “I don't like <span class="newword">capitalism</span>. Don't <span class="newword">impose</span> your <span class="newword">radical</span> ideas on my town. Go away!”
          </p>
          <p>So Joseph took his machine to the mayor at Wilton. This mayorthought Joseph's machine was <span class="newword">spectacular</span> and spent a long time looking at its different <span class="newword">components</span> made of <span class="newword">brass</span>. The mayor couldn't <span class="newword">refute</span> the fact that the machine had <span class="newword">drawbacks</span> that would affect the people's jobs. But he realized the machine could bring money and <span class="newword">prestige</span>. So he ordered Joseph to build twenty of them.
          </p>
          <p>Within a year, Wilton was a wealthy city, famous for its wonderful cloth. People no longer wove but worked in <span class="newword">managerial</span> jobs at cloth factories instead. Nobody bought the cloth from Netherton anymore. The people of Netherton became poor and hungry.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, the mayor of Netherton called Joseph and said, “Now I realize that your machine is not just a passing <span class="newword">fad</span>. To succeed in business, we must be willing to change.” He then ordered twenty weaving machines.
          </p>
          <p>After that, both Netherton and Wilton became rich cities, famous throughout the land for their wonderful cloth.</p>
