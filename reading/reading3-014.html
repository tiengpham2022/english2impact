        <h2>Day Without Sight</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>On Friday afternoon, Sam's teacher had a special assignment.
          </p>
          <p>“Next week, we'll be studying <span class="newword">humanitarian</span> efforts around the world since the time of the <span class="newword">Renaissance</span>, including those to help the blind,” she said. “Over the weekend, I want each of you to wear a blindfold for an entire day. The <span class="newword">premise</span> of this experiment is that it will help you understand what it's like to be blind,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>Sam was a <span class="newword">skeptic</span>. He really didn't think the assignment would be too challenging. On Saturday morning, Sam took a piece of cloth and tied it around his head to cover his eyes. Then he went into the kitchen for breakfast. He heard the voices of his parents and brothers but couldn't <span class="newword">specify</span> where each voice was coming from. He thought about how important hearing is for blind people.
          </p>
          <p>“Could you pass me the newspaper, please?” he asked. Just then, he remembered he couldn't see the words on the page. He wondered if <span class="newword">Braille</span> newspapers were ever made.
          </p>
          <p>After finishing breakfast, his brothers asked him to play soccer. As he followed them, he accidentally walked into the baker's <span class="newword">rack</span>. He also found that he couldn't play soccer. He wouldn't be able to <span class="newword">coordinate</span> his actions without being able to see. Without his <span class="newword">optic</span> senses, he had no <span class="newword">spatial</span> awareness. Furthermore, he couldn't do <span class="newword">simultaneous</span> activities because he had to make sure he was safe first.
          </p>
          <p>He sat on the lawn. Suddenly, he realized that though he couldn't see, his other senses worked perfectly fine. In fact, he began to realize new and different <span class="newword">aspects</span> of common objects. For example, he took a flower <span class="newword">bud</span> and felt it with his finger. He realized for the first time that it seemed to be covered with <span class="newword">wax</span>.
          </p>
          <p>His <span class="newword">hypothesis</span> about being blind was <span class="newword">disproved</span>. The <span class="newword">informative</span> experiment had an imprint on him. It showed him sight was an <span class="newword">asset</span> that should be appreciated and taught him to <span class="newword">revere</span> the talents of blind people.</p>
