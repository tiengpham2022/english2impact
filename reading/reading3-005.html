        <h2>A Famous Accident</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>One of the greatest <span class="newword">pharmaceutical</span> discoveries happened by accident. In his <span class="newword">haste</span> to go on vacation, Alexander Fleming had left his laboratory in a mess. The <span class="newword">essence</span> of his <span class="newword">ongoing</span> work involved a type of bacteria. An infection caused by the bacteria was often <span class="newword">terminal</span>, and he was looking for a <span class="newword">remedy</span>. He had left the bacteria out while he was away.
        </p>
        <p>When he returned from vacation, he found that his lab was covered in fungus. He started cleaning up the mess. While he was cleaning, he had an <span class="newword">impulse</span> to examine the fungus. He saw that whenever the fungus was in close <span class="newword">proximity</span> to the bacteria, the bacteria died.
        </p>
        <p>Though he was a messy scientist, his experiments were <span class="newword">precise</span>. He thought that there might be some <span class="newword">significance</span> to the fungus. He immediately <span class="newword">commenced</span> an experiment to <span class="newword">assess</span> what had happened to the bacteria. It had either died by accident or the fungus had killed it. The <span class="newword">subsequent</span> tests proved it was the <span class="newword">latter</span> reason.
        </p>
        <p>What he found <span class="newword">astonished</span> him. The fungus actually killed the bad bacteria. All this time, he had been looking for a <span class="newword">synthetic</span> material to kill the bacteria. Instead, a common fungus did the job.
        </p>
        <p>He knew that something in the fungus had killed the bacteria. His next step was to find those <span class="newword">molecules</span> that had done it. When he found them, he <span class="newword">extracted</span> them and put them into a pill. The drug proved to be very effective. It also worked against other types of harmful bacteria.
        </p>
        <p>The discovery received a lot of <span class="newword">publicity</span>. Soon after, the new drug was being used all over the world. Because of the success, the scientist was able to develop even more <span class="newword">fabulous</span> drugs to help people. His accidental discovery changed the world and helped save many people's lives.
