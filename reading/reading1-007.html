        <h2>The Best Prince</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
          <p>King Minos was very sick. His <span class="newword">condition</span> was getting worse. He had three sons. He loved them all. He had to <span class="newword">announce</span> who would become king.
          </p>
          <p>Two of the <span class="newword">princes</span> stood waiting outside the kin's room. Theseus was the oldest and strongest. He thought his father would make him king. Pelias, the second son, thought differently. He was an <span class="newword">expert</span> with weapons. He thought the king would choose him.
          </p>
          <p>“When I'm king,” Theseus told Pelias, “I'll let you <span class="newword">contribute</span> to the defense of our country. You can lead the army.”
          </p>
          <p>Pelias became angry. “Father knows I'm <span class="newword">famous</span> for my sword skills. He'll make me king.”
          </p>
          <p>“You?” Theseus yelled. “He won't choose you!”
          </p>
          <p>“The kingdom is mine!” Pelias <span class="newword">claimed</span>. “Father will give it to me—or I'll use <span class="newword">force</span> to take it!”
          </p>
          <p>Theseus made a <span class="newword">sudden</span> move to take out his sword. Then Pelias did the same.
          </p>
          <p>“Beating me will be a <span class="newword">challenge</span>,” Theseus said. “Fight me now. The winner gets the kingdom!”
          </p>
          <p>Pelias agreed.
          </p>
          <p>King Minos could hear his sons fighting. The youngest son, Jason, stood <span class="newword">beside</span> him. He <span class="newword">sensed</span> his father's sadness. The king laid his hand flat on Jason's arm.
          </p>
          <p>“Your brothers fight too much,” the king told him. “I must <span class="newword">protect</span> my kingdom from all <span class="newword">harm</span>. They'll <span class="newword">divide</span> it between them. The people won't know what to do. There'll be war. I can't <span class="newword">allow</span> either of them to be king. <span class="newword">Therefore</span>, I'm making you king. Your kindness has always made you special. It's the <span class="newword">difference</span> between you and your brothers. You can bring <span class="newword">peace</span>. They can't.”
          </p>
          <p>Then the king died. Theseus and Pelias heard that their youngest brother was king. They were surprised. They realized that their fighting was wrong. It had kept them from saying goodbye to their father. They agreed to have Jason as their king. He was the best choice.</p>
