        <h2>The Friendly Ghost</h2>
        <span class="newword"></span>
        <p>A nice woman lived by a large river. She loved children. She wanted to help them in any way. She loved her <span class="newword">community</span>, and everyone in the community loved her. She lived a very long time and became very <span class="newword">wise</span>.
        </p>
        <p>When she died, she became a <span class="newword">ghost</span>. She was <span class="newword">dead</span>, but every night she <span class="newword">returned</span> to her community. She wanted to help children and not to <span class="newword">cause</span> them <span class="newword">fright</span>. But she had a scary <span class="newword">voice</span>. Children were afraid of her, but the ghost was a good one. She only scared them to help them.
        </p>
        <p>One night, some children and a dog were playing by the river. They were having fun with their <span class="newword">pet</span>. But they were far from home. Then the <span class="newword">weather</span> became bad. It rained and rained. The river was rising. It was very dark. The children knew they were lost. They needed to go north, but they didn't know which direction it was. When the moon came out, they saw a ghost by the river. The ghost said, “Go away!”
        </p>
        <p>The children felt great fright. They knew it was a ghost. Then the ghost moved closer. She yelled again, “Go away!” The children became very <span class="newword">upset</span>. Some of them began to cry. The children knew they had a <span class="newword">choice</span>: they could <span class="newword">escape</span>, or they could stay and <span class="newword">face</span> this scary <span class="newword">individual</span> in the dark.
        </p>
        <p>The children ran a long <span class="newword">distance</span> away. The ghost <span class="newword">followed</span> them all the way.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the children <span class="newword">reached</span> home. The ghost was very happy. Soon the river rose higher and higher. It
        </p>
        <p>was very dangerous. The ghost had helped the children <span class="newword">survive</span>! She had saved them from the rising water. She also used her power to lead them home. Sometimes, meeting a ghost has <span class="newword">advantages</span>. A ghost can save you life!</p>
